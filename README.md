In this project you can select the movie you would like to see and also reserve the particular seat you would prefer to watch this movie from. You can slect multiple seats
Instantly you are presented with the number of seats selected and also the total relative cost.

I used my knowledge of the javascript Local storage in the execution of this project.
Hence even when the page is refreshed, data is not lost.

The project is live: https://movie-seat-booking-platfrom-by-waju.netlify.app/
